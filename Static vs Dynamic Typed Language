Data Type:
	A Data type in programming language refers to a characteristic that define the nature of the value that a data element has.
	Example: String, Integer, Character and Boolean

Type Checking:
	Every programming language has a system of checking that values have been assigned their correct types, which is known as Type Checking.
	
Compile Time:
  Phase in which Source code is converted to machine readable format.

Runtime:
  Time period between start and end of running intermediate code at runtime environment.



Static Typed Language:
	• Type checking occurs at Compile Time.
  • Variables are checked agaist types before Source code is compiled.
	• Explicit Type declaration is usually required.
	• Errors are detected earlier.
	• Variable assignments are static and cannot be changed.
	• Static Typed Language typically perform better at execution time because type checking has already been completed.
	
	• Example: Java, C, C++, C#
	
Dynamic Typed Language:
	• In Dynamically typed language, Type checking takes place at Runtime or execution time.
	• Variables are checked against types only when the program is executing.
	• Explicit Type declarations are not required.
	• Errors are detected later during execution.
	• Variable assignments are dynamic and can be altered.
	• There is a tendency for slower execution because they type information for every variable has to be retrieved at runtime
	
Example: Python, Javascript
